**Hacking Techniques for Beginners: A Guide by Vivek Kori**

**1. Understanding Ethical Hacking:**
   - Ethical hacking involves testing systems for vulnerabilities to improve their security. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any system.

**2. Learning the Basics of Networking:**
   - Understand how networks operate, including IP addresses, DNS, and protocols like HTTP and TCP/IP. This knowledge is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

**3. Familiarizing Yourself with Common Tools:**
   - **Nmap:** Network scanning tool to identify open ports and services.
   - **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer that helps in monitoring and analyzing network traffic.
   - **Metasploit:** Framework for testing and developing exploits.

**4. Mastering Basic Programming Skills:**
   - Learn languages like Python and Bash scripting. These skills help in automating tasks and writing custom scripts for vulnerability scanning and exploitation.

**5. Exploring Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Use tools like **Nessus** or **OpenVAS** to scan for vulnerabilities in systems. Regular vulnerability assessments help in identifying and fixing security weaknesses.

**6. Practicing with Legal Penetration Testing Platforms:**
   - **Hack The Box:** A platform offering various challenges to practice ethical hacking skills.
   - **TryHackMe:** Provides guided learning paths and hands-on labs for cybersecurity enthusiasts.

**7. Staying Updated with Security News:**
   - Follow cybersecurity news, blogs, and forums to keep up with the latest vulnerabilities and security practices.

**8. Obtaining Certifications:**
   - Consider certifications like **CompTIA Security+** or **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** to validate your skills and knowledge in ethical hacking.

**9. Building a Lab Environment:**
   - Set up a virtual lab using tools like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** to practice and test your skills safely without affecting real systems.

**10. Respecting Legal Boundaries:**
   - Always ensure that your hacking activities are authorized and comply with legal and ethical standards. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and punishable by law.

By following these guidelines, beginners can start their journey in ethical hacking while ensuring they operate within legal and ethical boundaries.
